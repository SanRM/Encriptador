## How it works

The application encrypts the entered text by replacing the vowels with their corresponding encryption keys. The substitution rules are as follows:

```
The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"
```
It is important to note that the application only works with lowercase letters and does not support accents or special characters.

### Usage
The user interface (UI) includes two main buttons, one for encryption and the other for decryption of the entered text. After performing either of these actions, a "Copy" button will appear to allow the user to easily copy the obtained result. Additionally, the application is responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
